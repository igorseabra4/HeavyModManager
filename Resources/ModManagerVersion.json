  "Description": "* [Feature] Add GameCube ISO export functionality\n  * Click \"Save ISO...\" to export your game with the selected mods enabled. You do not need the Dolphin paths set. This exports a shrunk ISO (without padding bytes). You can launch the ISO in Dolphin or copy it to storage for use with Nintendont, etc.  Thanks @parhamgholami for a bugfix to GCNTools which made this possible.\n* [Feature] Enable dark mode option\n  * By default, this uses the system theme. You can set it explicitly to use Dark or Classic under Settings\n* You can open the settings file (settings.json) directly through the Settings menu option for quick editing, if needed\n\nThanks @igorseabra4 and @energydrink02 for localisation efforts",
